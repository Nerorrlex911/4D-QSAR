    "Multi-instance (MI) machine learning approaches can be used to solve the issues of representation of each molecule by multiple conformations (instances) and automatic selection of the most relevant ones. In the multi-instance approach, an example (i.e., a molecule) is presented by a bag of instances (i.e., a set of conformations), and a label (a molecule property value) is available only for a bag (a molecule), but not for individual instances (conformations).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we have implemented several multi-instance algorithms, both conventional and based on deep learning, and investigated their performance. We have compared the performance of MI-QSAR models with those based on the classical single-instance QSAR (SI-QSAR) approach in which each molecule is encoded by either 2D descriptors computed for the corresponding molecular graph or 3D descriptors issued for a single lowest-energy conformation. \n",

    "Сonformations representing each molecule were generated using the algorithm implemented in RDKit. In our study, we generated up to 100 conformations and removed conformations with RMSD values below 0.5Å to the remaining ones to reduce redundancy.For the descriptor representation of conformations, we used previously developed 3D pharmacophore signatures. Each conformation is represented by a set of pharmacophore features (H-bond donor/acceptor, the center of positive/negative charge, hydrophobic, and aromatic) determined by applying the corresponding SMARTS patterns. All possible quadruplets of features of a particular conformation were enumerated. Distances between features were binned to allow fuzzy matching of quadruplets with small differences in the position of features. Here we used the 1Å bin step as it demonstrated reasonable performance in our previous studies. These signatures consider distances between features and their spatial arrangement to recognize the stereo configuration of quadruplets. We counted the number of identical 3D pharmacophore quadruplet signatures for each conformation and used the obtained vectors as descriptors for model building. 3D pharmacophore descriptors used in this study were implemented in the pmapper Python package (https://github.com/DrrDom/pmapper). \n",
    "To build 2D models, we chose binary Morgan fingerprints (MorganFP) of radius 2 and size 2048 calculated with RDKit because they are widely used 2D descriptors. For comparative purpose we also used 2D physicochemical descriptors (PhysChem) and binary 2D pharmacophore fingerprints (PharmFP) calculated with RDKit."
